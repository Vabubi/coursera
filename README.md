# Coursera Analysis

## Project Description

`coursera_analysis` is an exploratory data analysis project using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dataset comes from Coursera and contains information on nearly 900 courses. The aim is to identify which organizations and courses dominate in popularity, how certificate type and difficulty relate to enrollments, what factors underpin course success.

### Summary of Insights

* **Top Providers**: University of Michigan, Johns Hopkins, UC Irvine, Stanford, Yale, IBM, deeplearning.ai.
* **Top Courses**: Machine Learning (Stanford, 3.2M enrollments), The Science of Well-Being (Yale, 2.5M), Python for Everybody (Michigan, 1.5M).
* **Certificates**: Courses and Specializations dominate. Professional Certificates are rare.
* **Difficulty**: 55% Beginner courses, 22% Intermediate, 21% Mixed, 2% Advanced. Beginner drives ~40M enrollments, Mixed has highest percourse average.
